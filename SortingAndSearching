# Bubble Sort
-- Iterate over the array from start to end, if two neighbours are out of order swap them, repeat until array is sorted.
-- Called bubble sort based on the fact that bubbles in carbonated water float to the top, similarly bigger elements float to the top of the array i.e. higher indexes.
-- Best case O(n) performance, average and worst case are O(n^2). Due to poor performance this is a poor general purpose sorting algorithm.

# Insertion Sort
-- Iterate over the array from start to end, if two neighbours are out of order find the correct insertion place and then repeat.
-- Generally sorting algos need to be stable i.e. if two same elements need to be sorted the one which was found later should be stored later only and not moved before 
   the first one. For example the index of thesecond 4 should always come after the first 4s index
   [6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4, 8]
-- Best case O(n) performance, average and worst case are O(n^2). Due to poor performance this is a poor general purpose sorting algorithm. But if an array is nearly 
   sorted INSERTION sort offers better performance & is a good choice.

# Merge Sort
-- Divide & conquer. Split array into sub-arrays of a single item, compare individual items & merge items into sorted array
-- Best, average and worst case are O(log n)

# Quick Sort
-- Pick a pivot value, reorder elements around the pivot point, repeat.
-- Pivot value is 1) either random 2) select first or last array 3) Use median
-- All values to left of PIVOTs should be smaller than PIVOT & those to right should be greater.
-- Best & average case  O(log n), worst case O(n^2)

# LinearSearch
-- Scan start to end until you find the value.
-- O(n) performance because in the worst case we will find the element at last.

# Binary Search
-- Start with sorted array & look at the middle.
-- If your value > middle/pivot look to right else look left and do a linear search.
-- O(log n) performance if data is sorted.

# Naive String Search
-- Same as linear search, iterate over string untill we find a match
-- O(n+m) average case performance
-- O(nm) worst case performance
-- Requires no preprocessing of strings.
