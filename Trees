Trees store data in form of PARENT-CHILD relationship.
Each CHILD has ATMOST 1 PARENT. 
Each PARENT can have different CHILDREN based on type of tree.

# BINARY TREE
-- In BINARY TREES PARENT can have 1 or 2 CHILDREN. The ROOT node has no PARENT.
-- Edges connect nodes
-- Leaf nodes have no children
-- Internal nodes are those which are neither root nor children
-- Degree is the max number of children a node can have, for binary tree it is always 2
-- Level is the distance of node from the ROOT + 1. So root will have a LEVEL 1, the child of ROOT will have level 2 & so on.

# BINARY SEARCH TREE
-- A binary tree where the smaller values go to the left.
-- Insertion, Removal & searching in binary search tree has average case of O(log n) and worst case of O(n)

# B Trees
